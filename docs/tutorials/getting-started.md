# Getting started

## Running a local experience server:

*This tutorial assumes you have already installed Qubit-CLI and the Qubit-CLI chrome extension*

1. create a folder
```
mkdir demo
cd demo
```

2. scaffold a demo experience from the `example` template
```
qubit pull example
```

3. run your local experience server
```
qubit
```

4. open chrome

5. ![extension icon](../../chrome-extension/icons/off16.png) click on the extension icon. You should see the background of the page turn yellow!

6. change the background declaration in varaition.css to green. The background should update on the fly!
