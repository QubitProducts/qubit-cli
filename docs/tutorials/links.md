# Links
Sometimes its handy to jump from your terminal into the platform.

These shortcuts allow you to do so easily.

Run them from within an experience folder in order to go to:

```
qubit open editor // takes you to the experience editor page
qubit open overview // takes you to the experience overview page
qubit open settings // takes you to the experience settings page

qubit link editor // prints a link for the experience editor page
qubit link overview // prints a link for the experience overview page
qubit link settings // prints a link for the experience settings page
qubit link preview
```
